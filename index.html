<p id="instructions1">Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.
<br>What's so fun about a card game anyway? Memory is not only a favorite childhood pasttime, but it's beneficial to us as adults as well. Research shows that playing memory gives your brain a workout to help improve your visual memory, your cognitive functionality, as well as your concentration. Not only that, it's a fun activity, too!</p>
